# DSA-Amazon-Review-Project
This is how I built my excel project on DSA project named product review, after classes with the Incubator Hub.

This is where I put to work all I have learnt in the excel class after training with the Incubator Hub

## Project Topic: AMAZON PRODUCT REIEW

### Project Overview: This data analysis project is aimed at analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can
guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

### Data Source: My Primary data source is from my local drive, after downlading the data from my LMS.

### Tools Used: All the work was done using Microsoft excel:
 - Data collection: by uploading the data from my local drive
 - Data cleaning
   - Deleting some columns not needed.
   - Removing duplicated rows
   - removing blank rows
   - spliting columns with unneccessary long words and extracing the key words
   - Creating new colunms named percentage rating and using excel functions like [=IF(G3>=50%,"above 50%","below50%")
   - ``` excel function
     =IF(G3>=50%,"above 50%","below50%")
     ```
 - Pivot Table
 - Creating Dash board
